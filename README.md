# Project overview

## design implementation

Login for authentication -------> Fetch the list of Vehicles---->(clicked any one vehicle card)
|
|
|---->Plot the updated location of the vehicle on the Map via firebase
|
|----------------> Back to prev Page
|
|---->back to previous vehicle listing page

                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |----------------> Logout -------> redirect to Login page

:heavy_check_mark: Tech stack used for this project is: React, Tailwind-css, firebase

:heavy_check_mark: Login for authentication
-> Login component to take input value of email and password verify them and "fetch" user Data from "API end point" using POST method.

Test credentials are

Username: jeewan.thapa9@gmail.com
Password: tracknerd@123

:heavy_check_mark: Display the total list of Vehicle
-> Fetch the list of Vehicles -> using fetch web api to call api by GET method, and
show vehicle cards (update live vehicle data from firebase)

:heavy_check_mark:Live Vehicle Tracking on Map
->Plotting the updated location (on the event trigger of firebase) of the checked vehicle on the Map

:heavy_check_mark: click on logout button redirect to login screen and session are cleared.

:heavy_check_mark: used React best practice like performance optimization used code splitting for optimize build and file and folder structure, code reusability and etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
